What does define who we are? Is it what we do? is it what we make?
Why should we make?
Does making in itself imply a reason in the world other that just being?
What is being? Is it a ultimate challenge to ourselves to find a complete trance like state of plentiful emptiness? Eckart finds it to be the case in his book the power of now but I only really find myself in those deep conversations that one talks without feeling the need to think what is ahead, express.
Making is a representation of ones self and I am the maker, tho you shall not define me because I am the Definition.
